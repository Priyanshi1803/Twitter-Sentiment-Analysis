# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

In this project, I conducted Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis on the Twitter US Airline Sentiment Dataset, which encompasses a vast collection of over 14,000 tweets. Employing a range of classification techniques, including Support Vector Machine, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Decision Trees, I successfully predicted the sentiment of these tweets, categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral.
